# Callisto
Lo-fat Design System



### Rationale

While design systems are everywhere under multiple disguises, failed attempts and half-baked guidelines, some have managed the feat to be usable and easy-to-use… Somewhat. _As a designer_, I've been for a long time resticent to such documentations/scaffoldings for two simple reasons:

- Building a design system is time-consuming;
- A design system rarely stand the test of time;

We tend to always hear about designers from _agencies_, _third parties_ and _design studios_ but not from the field —Because _there are_ designers working close to the metal, directly as entreprises employees, large or SMB's, and these teams tend to be small, with way less firepower or strategic capability. For those designers, building and maintaining a design system is _hard_.



##### Main features/objectives

- Low css footprint;
- Antifragile typographic system;
- Context aware layout and color palette;

Could be cited some similar projects of note, like [LightningDesign System](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com) from Salesforce or the ever expanding, gigantic omniscious pastafarian creature, [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
